/**
 * @brief A ROS-control controller for Cartesian motion tracking
 *
 * This controller is meant for tracking Cartesian motion that is not known in
 * advance.  Common use cases are teleoperation or Cartesian end effector
 * teaching, in which the Cartesian motion is commanded with discrete target
 * poses.
 *
 * The controller receives the targets as \a geometry_msgs::PoseStamped
 * messages and tries to reach those as best as possible.  Users can adjust the
 * controller's responsiveness to those targets with setting individual PD
 * gains for each Cartesian dimension.
 *
 * One benefit is that the controller automatically interpolates to obtain
 * smooth joint commands for distant, discretely sampled targets.
 * Users achieve this with setting qualitatively low P gains.
 *
 * For uses cases where a more precise tracking is needed, users may configure
 * this controller to a fast Inverse Kinematics solver, with setting
 * qualitatively high P gains. Note, however, that this requires
 * high-frequently published targets to avoid jumps on joint level.
 *
 * @tparam HardwareInterface The interface to support. Either PositionJointInterface or VelocityJointInterface
